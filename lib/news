                 THE DIKUMUD HERALD - Sunday, April 7th - 1991

We do NOT want people to play more than one character at the time! If we catch 
someone doing this, we'll... we'll, er... anyhow, it's gonna hurt - 
don't do it. It's considered cheating, and will be treated as such.

It now takes TIME for a thief to steal!
