The hills~
   You are on a small bewildered path winding its way between the hills in
lack of better things to do. To the south you have a splendid view over the
flat, vast, desolate plains. To the north the hills grow steadily darker and
foreboding. This is the cause of no sunset, it is rather the power of evil
penetrating these quiet hills. Glancing around you notice only a single bird.

The hills~
   You are surrounded by dark and sinister hills. Although they seemed fairly
small from a distance you now get the feeling that they're closing in on you,
towering over you, overwhelming you...
The small path seems to have second thoughts about these hills because it
starts winding unnecessarily, turning several times around itself.
To the south the hills have a lighter hue of dark. To the north however, the
hills have become nightblack holes in the distant mountains.

End of the path~
   At this point the path has had enough. With a terrified shudder it cowers
to the ground, only staying here because you're standing on it. with a slight
feeling of unease you look around noticing only a few bushes and a large sign
carved into the mountain.
You feel you can hear the cry of help from a thousand silent voices all coming
from an even darker hole in the mountain to the north marking the entrance to
a cave (or a grave :-).

The cave~
   You are in a large cave. The ceiling is lost somewhere above the reach of
your light. The floor, however, is highly illuminated, your light flickering
over several tombstones. Only one is whole, the rest have been shattered by
some savage blow. The remaining tombstone looks disturbingly new...
A small breeze of fresh air enters from the south (probably lost too). Take a
good breath, it may be your last mouthful of air in a long, long time that
others haven't breathed before you.
To the north a small tunnel continues into the mountain.

You've just stepped into the most unlucky position in the whole of DikuMUD.

With an acceleration of approximately 9.82 metres per second per second, you
are now descending the Abyss. What awaits you at the bottom will continue to
be a mystery. Bye Cruel World.

The Kitchen of Naris~
This must be the place of food and drink. You can hear the faint noise of 
rats feasting on meat and bread from somewhere undeterminable. The sound
makes you feel the agony of HUNGER. The only visible exit is south to the
Northern end of the hall. To the north there is a larder, and to the east
stands a fridge.

You can see up and down the stairway. It seems to take forever, either going
up OR down. It's just a seemingly insurmountable climb, either way. Up is the 
bedroom of Redferne, and Down leads to the Southern end of the hall.

Redferne's Bedroom~
This is a snugly set bedroom with all the necessities for a romantic evening.
A large fireplace adourns the east wall, and sizzling away is the wood that
is ablaze within. The bed is enormous, covering at least HALF of this great
room. This stretches at least 140 square feet, so can you imagine the BED?
A large staircase leads down to the hall. A couple of doors open up to a

The Chain where it's too windy~
Hanging on to the chain you figure out that there's no way of leaving down 
from here. The wind pulls you from left to right and back. This seems like a
totally impossible task. The ascend is the only way ahead for you.
Otherwise you would risk death by falling to the hard ground below. DO NOT
DESCEND NOW OR YOU'LL SURELY DIE!!!!

The Chain~
As you descend, the chain seems to absorbe all weather around it, making it
swing less and less in the very powerful wind tearing at it. The Chain seems
to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
           ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.

of a great, pale-blue inverted pyramid to the south. Some two yards

continues north, sweeping over the horizon.

The matrix fault~
   You are standing on the bottom of a wide crack in the matrix, going 
north and south. The sides of the fault are alive with writhing 
worm-like things, snaking out from the cracked glass, sparking madly.
To your west, a pile of great slabs of glass has fallen into a jumble 
beside the wall. They are much too large and sharp-edged for you to 
lose your precious fingers on! To the south, there is at least four 
yards between the furthest reaches of the worm-like strands, but to the

   This is Dragons' dining hall. There is a large long solid oak table,
seating at least 24, with heavy, wooden chairs to match. The oak panel walls
are filled with paintings. There are doors to the north and east, and to the
west there is a wide double door opening out onto the sunlit terrace.

painting paintings~
There are many, many beautiful paintings of famous dragons of history and
literature. There is a big one of Smaug, a group picture of Cuspidorian Toxic
Dragons, a rather fearsome picture of norse Chaos incarnate, a grainy black-
and-white photograph of Vorgulremik the Steel Dragon, a romantic picture of 
Dalvenjah the Mindijaran and Allan the man become dragon. There are three
empty frames labeled 'The Chimerical', 'The Mythical' and 'The Hypothetical',
A panoramic picture of Strabo flying between the worlds dominate one wall, 
while a dragons-eye view of Pern (with dragons in the foreground, of course) 
fills another. There even are a few rare medieval renditions of the great 
beast of the Revelation. Over the head of the table hangs a rather modest 
portrait of a silver Dragon, sparkling with blue lightening, looking amused.

The terrace~
   You are standing on a sunlit terrace in front of Dragon's mansion. To the
west, there is a splendid view over the field down over the lake. To the north
is the greenhouse, its large windowpanes shimmering with weird and wonderful
colors, while a double door leads into the house proper to the east. It is
warm and calm here. There is a white-painted table with a parasol here,
together with a matched set of chairs.

The fog~
   You are in a grey fog, falling, screaming in pain as you realize
that you are being torn to nothing, atom by atom, falling and falling 
and falling......
