              Rules for Immortal Player Behaviour

Upon becoming immortal, you are no longer considered a player in DikuMud,
you simply cannot get killed. Therefore, there are certain rules you must
follow. Knowingly breaking these rules will probably cost you your
characters(s).

 - An immortal must not support ANY mortal playing character in the game,
   including his/her own caracter. Supporting includes grouping, items,
   money, 'preparing' monsters for easy killing, etc.
      You may occasionally help low-level players by giving them
   small amounts of money or items. You may only give them what is
   buyable in the shops, and never more than 500 gold coins worth.
      Immortals are welcome to take part in the game, by creating
   unexpected (but never unreasonably harmful) obstacles for the players,
   or by providing divine assistance to a newcomer in distress. Usage
   of the 'switch'-command to make the monsters more challenging or
   entertaining is also acceptable - see the rules about harming players,
   below.

 - An immortal is allowed to play other characters, provided that he/she
   does not support them - see above. Beware: It is very hard not to help
   your mortal player, and we'll show virtually no mercy, should we find out.
     Exception from this rule can be made ONLY for test purposes, and only
   by immortals who are actually building or supervising areas of the
   world. Other players should NEVER benefit or suffer from this.
   Test characters should not be a nuisance to other players in any way.

 - An immortal character is not allowed to harm mortal players
   in any way, unless this player is extremly provocative and
   annoying to others.

   Any action taken against mortals should have a VERY good reason.

 - Implementors of DikuMUD reserves right to change any of the
   above rules.

 - A frequently asked question is what to do after a game crash. In general,
   you shouldn't do anything. However, if you feel up to it, and if you
   feel very confident that you aren't being cheated (grabbed by the nose,
   as they say in Denmark), you are allowed to make compensations for the
   losses of the players. Still, the rule in this case is, 'better too
   little than too much'.

"Any excuse is a bad excuse" - Papi

These are just suggestions:

 - You could hang around talking to other players.

 - You may apply for building a new area in the world of DikuMud.
   Send a letter to the Central Commitee of DikuMud Building Junta
   Association. This may be sent to either:
     Tom Madsen (noop@freja.diku.dk)
     Michael Seifert (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
     Sebastian Hammer (quinn@freja.diku.dk)
   We will then return a letter explaining the Building rules.

 - You may apply for World Supervisor. A supervisor is
   assigned an area(s) which other immortals are building. The idea
   is that you test the area, give ideas for changes, inform the
   creator of rare items which are too easy to obtain. Etc.
   The Supervisor is "higher rank" than the creator, and can always send
   a letter to the Central Commitee of DikuMud Building Junta Association
   in cases of disagreement with the creator.
   This is a highly trusted position, and you will have to prove worthy
   somehow.
   For more information send a letter asking for more rules.

satchel bag~
While the bag in it self look ordinary enough, even perhaps somewhat
dingy, the closing mechanism is rather unusual (and somewhat noisy), as
it consists of to strips of strange cloth which sticks to each other 
like burrs, but doesn't stick to anything else. It makes a loud 'ripping' 
sound when opened.

It is big, 3 meters wide and more than two meters tall, leaving plenty of air
above it under the ceiling. There is a large door set in the side, and a solid-
looking handle and lock in the door.

lock handle~
The lock-and-handle arrangement is rather strange. Apparently, one inserts a

It is an unusual spanner... It seems to be designed for bolts that have, not

It is 10 X 15 X 2", and quite regular. It is transparent, and, while 
probably not glass, it still feels like glass. There are a large number 
of tiny, needlethin blue lines inside it, and a 1 X 1" square red 
button near one corner.

It is a wonderful Boris Vallejo painting of a husky barbarian and a
scantily-clad lady, with large letters saying:

"            	looking for a
			GOOD TIME?"

and at the bottom:

"	NEW & EXCITING Attration, Right Here:
		The MAZE, with:

		* Mountains & Valleys *
		* Tunnels & Trolls    *
		* Danger & Adventure  *

			presented to You by
				the DRAGON   "

Pasted across it is a white paper with atrocious purple letters,
obstructing the view of the better parts.

It is annoying, since you cant see the _good_ parts of the Vallejo
poster, but it seems to be glued on pretty solid.
